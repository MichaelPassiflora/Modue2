          <dd>
As a designer at SMU Guildhall, you will learn to bring art and code to life as you design the "fun". You're the jack of all trades that makes all things work in concert. Designers use scripting and art to create worlds, craft gameplay, and define player flow.           </dd>

Production students learn to make games as developers with cross-disciplinary teams in a studio simulation. In the studios, you build content, lead teams, mentor junior producers and leads, conduct usability studies, publish student games, and research team dynamics. Producers also study a secondary specialization (art, design or programming) in the first sequence of the program in order to develop foundational skills for making games.          </dd>

          <dd>
Programmers at SMU Guildhall focus on writing code to breathe life into games by integrating the work of artists and designers, bringing characters and environments to life. You will practice each of the many facets of gameplay programming as well as the study of game engine architectures, both in commercial engines and your own game engine, which you’ll build from the ground up.          </dd>
